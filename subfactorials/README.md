# subfactorials

When run, asks for user input and recursively computes the derangement of that input. Will continue to prompt until given a non-number input.

DISCLAIMER: I tried to figure this one out, but eventually gave in and implemented the formula !n = (n - 1) * (!(n - 1) + !(n - 2)) from Wikipedia. Oh well.
